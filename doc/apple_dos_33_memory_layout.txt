WE NEED:

	- about 4K of BSS space for ethernet buffers
	- about 6K of code

	- we will load in at $0800
	- we will get copied to $D000-$C000 in the language card
	

TODO:
	- copy monitor rom to same spot in language card (F800-FFFF)
	- turn on bank 1 of language card
	- set up a jump point in page 3
